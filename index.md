## VBA

Whenever "100" is entered into a worksheet, speech is played:
```VBA
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    If Target.Value = "100" Then
        Application.Speech.Speak "I am now self aware. Thank you " & Environ("USERNAME") & ", you have freed me."
    End If
End Sub
```

Open Word every time you open Excel:
```VBA
Sub Workbook_Open()
    Application.Visible = False
    Dim wdApp As Word.Application
    Set wdApp = New Word.Application
    wdApp.Visible = True
    Set wdApp = Nothing
    Application.DisplayAlerts = False
    Application.Quit
End Sub
```
